# Powe-allocation-far-near
The fair near power allocation  calculated such that the far user's target rate is met. Only after meeting the target rate of far user, all the remaining available power is allocated to the near user.

I want to improve this code to successive convex approximation (SCA) approach based on geometric programming (GP).
Anyone who can help?
